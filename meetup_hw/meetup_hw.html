    <h2><u>Corey Shafer's Django Tutorial</u></h2>
    <p>The course that I attended for this assignment was a tutorial by youtube educator Corey Shafer.
       I've followed some of his courses before which focus primarily on Python as well frameworks and
       libraries which work with this language. The web development tutorials listed were for both the Flask
       and Django frameworks. I had been interested in Django so I decided to go with this course.</p>
    <p>This youtube channel has easily been my favorite resource I've found since starting learning
       programming. His videos are organized into relevant topics which walk you through how to actually
       build real programs. It is not too slow or fast paced and touches upon all of the pitfalls which may
       come up. Not only does he clearly explain these subjects but also explains the reasons behind many
       of the techniques used.</p>
    <p>This specific tutorial takes you through the process of building a web application starting with
       basic Python all the way through building web pages using HTML/CSS and deployment. While there are
       some prerequisites to this tutorial, supplementary videos and web pages are suggested which cover these
       topics. In total there are 17 videos in this series which vary from around 10 minutes to over an hour.
       While this course takes quite a bit of time, when finished you'll have a complete web application running
       live on the internet.</p>
