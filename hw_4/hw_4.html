      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>Green Canyon Elementary is the top school in Green Canyon Country. At Green Canyon we strive to meet each student
         at their own level. We support them in improving their reading, math, humanities and science. We also have a 2000 square foot cafeteria
         serving healthy, nutritous and delicous food. Please notify staff with any dietary restrictions. We are proud to announce
         the addition of our new state of the art gym with full size basketball court and bleachers which sit 1000 guests.</p>
