    <h2><u>How to Get the Most Out of Mornings</u></h2>
    <p>Breakfast can be a tricky meal when you're trying to stay healthy. The allure of waffles
       and bacon can be strong, but there are some alternatives out there which can satisfy just as well.</p>
       <ul>
          <li>Substitute bacon with chicken sausage or smoked salmon to lower calories and add nutrients</li>
          <li>Replace waffles or pancakes with sweet potato or hash browns</li>
          <li>Use olive oil instead of butter to fry eggs</li>
       </ul>
    <p>Often cooking just after waking is not an appealing task. Sticking a pop tart in the toaster is a lot
       easier than cooking a healthy meal, especially when we haven't had our coffee or tea yet. This is why making
       a big batch of breakfast foods earlier can keep us from the sugery treats. Just stick a tupperware in
       the microwave and we've got ourselves a healthy breakfast!</p>
