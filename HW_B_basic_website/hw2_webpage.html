    <h2>How to Get the Most Out of Mornings:</h2>
    <p>Breakfast can be a tricky meal when you're trying to stay healthy. The allure of waffles
       and bacon can be strong, but there are some alternatives out there which can satisfy just as well.
       By substituting bacon with something like chicken sausage or smoked salmon can lower calories
       and add nutrients. Replacing waffles or pancakes with sweet potato or hash browns can do the same.</p>
    <p>Often cooking just after waking is not an appealing task. Sticking a pop tart in the toaster is a lot
       easier than cooking a healthy meal, especially when we haven't our coffee or tea yet. This is why making
       a big batch of breakfast foods earlier can keep us from the sugery treats. Just stick a tupperware in
       the microwave and we've got ourselves a healthy breakfast.</p>
