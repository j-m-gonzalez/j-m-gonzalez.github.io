      <p style="margin-top: 190px;">Hi, I'm Jonathan. I'm from San Francisco and grew up right by Lake Merced.
         I went to school in the city then lived in Santa Cruz, San Anselmo and Alameda
         for a few years at a time but I always came back to San Francisco.
         I've worked as a computer draftsman, a social worker and at a bakery.
         For now I'm learning more about computers and hope these skills can
         eventually provide income.</p>
      <p>My introduction to programming started with python. Seeing others get
         jobs programming and seeing the growth of this field led me to be interested
         in learning more. I started to see how programming is a useful tool in
         so many fields from simple accounting to science to finance. I started
         to enjoy learning more about computers and eventually fell into learning
         the web framework Django. While fun, I found I could use some more education
         in front end programming so I have been learning HTML and CSS for a while.
         While initially it never led me to web development, I've been using
         <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>
         for about 9 years. The vastness and depth of this site always had me finding
         new interesting things. The random communities that pop up are entertaining,
         sometimes emotional and usually informative. Once I learned some programming,
         I noticed all of the little references reddit has to programming languages like
         the use of "self" and collapsable comment trees.</p>
         <p>The internet wasn't always as popular as it is today. For a time it existed at the
            fringe of culture, only used by enthusiasts. Around the start of the new millennium
            popularity of the world wide web rose sharply along with new technologies which made
            this rise possible. The story of this rise is talked about more in depth in this article about
            <a href="https://www.techopedia.com/2/31579/networks/a-brief-history-of-web-development#the-turn-of-the-century" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web development in the turn of the century</a>

        <h2>Good Links</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>One great resource for learning web technologies is <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The web delelopment training site W3Schools.</a>
                This site provides tutorials and examples of all of the most popular web technologies from Python to PHP to Javascript.</li>
            <li><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The developer forum Stack Overflow</a> is essential to any developer.
                just about any question about programming is answered and if it isn't, a community of experienced developers will provide and answer.
            <li>At this point just about anyone will be familiar with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the video hosting site YouTube</a>.
                But users might not know that there are tons of helpful instructional videos on just about any topic, especially programming and web technologies.
